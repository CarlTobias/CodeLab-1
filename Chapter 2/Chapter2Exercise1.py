# Exercise 1:
# Assign a message to a variable, and print that message.
# Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new message.

print("\nExercise 1\n")

# firstly, i assigned a variable named chris with a string value
chris = "Chris Hemsworth"
# i then printed a message that uses the string value
print("My favourite Chris is " + str(chris) + ".\n")

# after, i assigned another string value to the same variable
chris = "Chris Evans"
# i then printed the same message earlier
print("My favourite Chris is " + str(chris) + ".\n")

# note: when you run the program,
# you will notice that the value of the variable changes
# because of the hierarchy of which the code is placed
