# Exercise 2:
# Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author.
# Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
# Albert Einstein once said, â€œA person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

print("\nExercise 2\n")

# the first thing i did was to assign a variable to a string value (which is the quote)
quote = "Thank you for being you because in my opinion, you're great and I think you shouldn't stop being you for anyone, and if anyone says stop being you, STUFF THEM."

# after that, i printed the variable and concatenated it with the following:
print('"' + quote + '"\n-Bradley Simpson')
