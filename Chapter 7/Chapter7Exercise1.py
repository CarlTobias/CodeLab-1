# Exercise 1:
# Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone
# what you are learning about in this chapter.
# Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.

print("\nExercise 1\n")

# here, i defined a function and named it "learn()"
def learn():
    # inside the function, i told the program to print text
    print("I'm learning to define my own functions!\n")

# now, outside the function, i told the program to print text, greeting the user
print("Hello!")
# and i used the function to execute the commands inside the function
learn()
