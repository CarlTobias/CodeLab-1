# Exercise 3:
# Write a loop that never ends, and run it.
# (To end the loop, press ctrl-C or close the window displaying the output.)

print("\nExercise 3\n")

# first off, i assigned number 1 to a variable
time1 = 1

# and to make this loop infinite,
# i told the program to run the block of code below as long as the variable equals 1
while time1 == 1:
    print("Why are you hitting yourself?")
    print("*slap noises\n")
