# Exercise 3:
# Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list
# that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as
# “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

print("\nExercise 3\n")

# first, i made a list of strings containing modes of transportation
transpo = ["metro", "private jet", "bike"]

# then, i printed the strings one by one (each with their own concatenated sentences)
print("The " + transpo[0] + " is my go-to way of public transportation.")
print("I'm rich, so I take a " + transpo[1].title() + " to go to school.")
print("I love to ride my " + transpo[2] + " on the weekends.\n")
